Minimal OSX Virtual Machines
============================

This repository contains some helper scripts to work with xhyve virtual machies
on OSX. The motivation comes from the fact that xhyve provies a minimal set of
functionality making it somewhat combersome create and launch VMs.


Potential todos:
- More better create command functionality
- Automatically find kernels in disk images
- Pure python ext2/3/4 kernel extraction
